## Fish Tank Solution Mixer

A mini-project purpose built for a vat of calcium carbonate solution. The device fits onto the lid of the vat, where a mixing head dips into the solution. A time interval can be set in between mixing cycles.

### The Problem

An alkaline solution of calcium carbonate is used for the operation of a tropical fish tank. However, the solution becomes saturated with extra particulates settling at the bottom. 



### Design Considerations

The effectiveness of mixing is the most important aspect of this problem. The mixer should be able to effectively mix the settled particles from the bottom of the vat, in a way that nearly homogenously distributes it within the rest of the solution. A secondary requirements of the device is the displacement of the mixing head and the material used for it. Too much displacement of liquid in the vat will reduce the efficiency of the Fish Tank system. As for the mixing head's material, it must not degrade or react within the solution.

### Initial Approaches

The first revision of the mixing head was meant to simply induce a vortex within the vat, but the particles at the bottom would not be lifted up efficiently.

A fully analog system using a 555 timer was considered, but would reduce the ease of adjustability between mix intervals.
